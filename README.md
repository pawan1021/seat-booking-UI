# Seat-booking-UI

The movie booking system project offers users a seamless experience with features like a movie list, dropdown menu for movie selection, seat layout displaying available, selected, and occupied seats, and a confirmation container showing selected seats and total price. Users can interact by selecting seats, viewing prices, and proceeding with booking or canceling. With no external dependencies, this project encourages contributions through pull requests for enhancements and modifications to the stylesheet, JavaScript functionality, and HTML structure.
